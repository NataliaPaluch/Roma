			<h1>Coastal Beaches</h1>

			For many tourists Roman holiday are inextricably linked to at least one day stay on the Tyrrhenian sea. And rightly so, because the capital of Italy and lies, and more specifically one of its districts - Ostia. Although it is away from the center of Rome approx. 20 km, it is easy to get there by subway or public buses ground to enjoy its beaches and monuments (Ancient Ostia). <br/> <br/>
For the average a Roman Ostia, however, mainly beaches. At over 14 km of sandy beaches are public beaches, both public as well as private baths paid. Both of them are usually equipped with showers, changing rooms, restaurants and bars. <br/> <br/>

<h3> Public beaches - FREE BEACH </h3>
<br/>
One of the most famous and free of charge beaches Roman is several kilometers dune beach Capocotta in Castel Porziano / Pratica di Mare, made available to the Romans until 1965 by the then president of Italy, Sandro Pertiniego, as it was previously reserved exclusively for its disposal. It is divided into several zones for different purposes. There are sections devoted to bathing for families, Oasis Naturists, gay beach, beach for animal lovers. Mere mortals usually choose one of the first seven episodes, marked with the name cancello 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 (Italian for "cancello" means gate, entrance). These are the sections of free public beaches, each with parking (small), bar, toilets, changing rooms and rental chairs and umbrellas. Mandatory on every beach lifeguards on duty.
After seven episodes bathing city (actually eight because eight is closed), followed by unpaid beaches "special": wild, presidential, gay, nude, and last - family, which we recommend. <br/> <br/>

<h3> The beaches of Ostia with the center of Rome </h3>

<h3> Beaches pay </h3>
<br/>
For example, the price of 2 beach chairs and an umbrella in Ostia, will cost 15 euros per day. A little further on, in the village of Fregene, prices reach 25 euros. The cost of the monthly voucher for two people ranges from 400 to 750 euros! These record prices of beach equipment put Lazio in third place in the ranking of the most expensive beaches of Italy, right after the Liguria and Tuscany! <br/> <br/>
Expenditure, however, does not end - the prices of sun loungers and parasols to be added even access to the beach, not the cheapest parking fees, and of course the price of drinks and snacks in the beach bars. <br/> <br/>

<h3> The formula of "happy hour" </h3>
<br/>
Given the "salt money" owners of swimming pools, for fear of losing customers increasingly bring the formula of "happy hour" in order to attract and retain the greatest number of summer visitors. Offer lower rates for those who come to the beach in the afternoons only (price lounger: 4.5 euro instead of 8 euro on holidays after hours. 16:00 and 3 euros instead of 6 euros on weekdays after hours. 14:00). It is perhaps a solution for those who want to save, but unfortunately not for families with children who usually opt for sunbathing in the morning, when the air is still crisp, and the beach is not as crowded as in the afternoon. <br/> <br/>
