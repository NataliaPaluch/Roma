It is a great testament to the great level of architecture and construction of the Roman Empire.<br/><br/>

Amphitheater designed by an unknown architect of us brought up in an environment Greco-Roman, who used the building experience of several generations, supplementing pre-existing patterns of such buildings with several innovations own. The construction of the Colosseum began in approx. 70 or 72 r. At the behest of the founder of the Flavian dynasty, the emperor Vespasian. It was built on the site of the artificial lake graces the famous "Golden House" Emperor Nero (Domus Aurea). Vespasian, who came to power through a military coup, he would thereby win the favor of the Roman people, necessary for the consolidation of the acquired power. As admired by all the citizens of Rome and conqueror of the Jewish uprising in Palestine, the emperor had large financial resources and the great mass of prisoners slaves. 80 r. A.D. Vespasian's son and successor, Emperor Titus inaugurated the amphitheater, offering people the Roman wells games, which killed approx. 900 convicts-gladiators and approx. 9,000 pieces of wild animals. Over the next centuries the Colosseum has seen thousands of these days, where the roar of the beast killed and the blood of the wounded or killed gladiators syci≈Çy revenge and a strong entertainment of thousands of Romans. Originally gladiators were soldiers, who presented to the audience their skills, but over time replaced them with slaves and prisoners fighting to the death.<br/> <br/>
The Colosseum has survived the centuries, but inside the little remains of the original features adorning the stands and the wall. In 217 r. Arena and top floors were destroyed by a huge fire; in subsequent years, earthquakes and smaller fires in succession destroyed the individual batches of the amphitheater. In the fourteenth century, after the great earthquake in 1349, the Colosseum has become a mine of building stone (here come the blocks used for construction include Palazzo Venezia and Palazzo Barberini). Uncertain fate of the building lasted until 1744., When Pope Benedict IV sanctified it and declared the place of martyrdom of Christians. Since the second half of the eighteenth century, every Good Friday takes place here Way of the Cross under the leadership of the Pope. <br/> <br/>
